% Encoder: (Use 4:2:0 YCbCr component image)
% (a) Compute the 8x8 block DCT transform coefficients of the luminance and chrominance components of the image.
% • Please display the DCT coefficient matrix as well as image of the DCT transformed image blocks of the first 2 blocks in the 6th row (of blocks) from top for the luminance component. (15 points)
% (b) Quantize the DCT image by using the JPEG luminance and chrominance quantizer matrix from the lecture notes.
% • Report the following output only for the first 2 blocks in the 6th row from top of the luminance component:

ycbcrsubsample = GetSubSample(); % From
